Introduction 
Nowadays, technology is making a significant impact on changing the world and easing jobs of individuals. And new small companies are being started every day. One of them, a new start-up, which specializes in making mobile applications for both Android systems and IOs systems, wants to gain modern software and hardware tools for creating new programs in the given areas. As many of start-ups are, this start-up is not big and does not need lots of tools or other things. However, it is significantly advised that new software and hardware tools, computers and servers should be targeted to achieve a great development process which contains five important aspects of it: prototyping, design, project management, development process, and also testing process. Furthermore, while making the list, urges of all other development team members such as project manager, tester or programmer should be taken into account. 
Review of hardware and solutions  
Hardware
If we give some info about mobile app development: “Mobile app development is basically the process or action through which a specific mobile application is developed for different mobile devices, like mobile phones, personal digital assistants, etc. Mobile apps can actually be pre-installed on particular phones throughout manufacturing platforms, and they can also be delivered as concrete web apps which use client-side or server-side processing to get to provide a similar experience with a web browser” (Romano, A. 2019). So, as IT consultancy company, it is highly recommended that the start-up company should be provided appropriate hardware tools and packs. Taking into account that this company builds both Android and IOs apps, iMac desktops and Windows PCs are recommended to the team. Because both of them have their limitations and great advantages. For example, Windows PCs are easy to collect and it can be built manually, but for IOs development, they cannot be used. Also, iMacs can be used both Android or IOs systems, it’s hard to customize iMacs configuration.
When it comes to reference more specifically, the recommended CPU is a quad-core i5 processor and RAM is 8GB.  And most of programmers and designers need bigger screens because it is easier working with lots of apps simultaneously. And also, retina displays make more quality in performance. For servers, cloud servers are today’s most popular and safe servers. For example, Google App Engine and Amazon AWS. Also, the company can create their own server for their all apps. And more information is given in the table below. 
Software
In this section, software and hardware recommendations are given according to team members which are designers, developers, project managers and testers.
In starting of any new app, there should be appropriate design for this application. And also, it’s beneficial for marketing and UI aspects. And in order to choose the appropriate version of prototyping tools, they are some factors which should be evaluated. They are learning curve, sharing, usage, ease of use, cost and fidelity. Taking into account these factors, we can recommend a few tools such as InVision, Adobe Experience Design (Xd), Origami Studio, Sketch, Adobe Photoshop and so on. They provide easy collaboration among team members and also have cost benefits.
And picking up the appropriate development tools and packs is very essential for making great applications. Because it is the main aspect of this process. There are two types of mobile development tools which are native mobile development tools and cross-platform mobile tools. For native tools, XCode, Android Studio and AppCode are great tools for usage. For cross-platform tools, Ionic, BuildFire.js and Xamarin are nice tools. They both can provide lots of comfortabilities for programmers. For example, in Xcode there is live rendering function makes hand-written UI code in canvas, and instantly changes when typing in Code. Or Android studio gives code shortcuts, and also provides drag and drop features for designing projects.
  Managing projects is also one of the crucial parts of app development and without this aspect, app development cannot be imagined. Best practices of project management tools are Basecamp, Trello, Jira, Github and Wrike. They help to divide tasks easily among team members, time management, share files and images, planning sprints, manage issues, track project performance, create descriptions and provide instructions and comments to tasks and so on.  With that kind of tools, managing part of work can be significantly easy and accurate for evaluation purposes.
Testing what you made is also one of the important parts of app making process. Because any app may have bugs or the parts which no one cared about or were given small attention. And in this case this kind of tools makes our job more efficient and shows what is what. Selenium, TestingWhiz, HPE Unified Functional Testing and TestComplete are best examples of testing tools. For instance, Selenium is a testing framework used for various platforms like Windows, Mac or Linux. And also it helps team testers to write tests in several programming languages such as Python, PHP, Groovy, Perl, Java and so on. Or TestingWhiz can offer lots of crucial features like browser extension testing, SMTP Integration, or integration with bug tracking tools such as Jira, Mantis or FogBugz.  
When it comes to infrastructure as a service (IaaS), one of the given solutions is Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and application programming interfaces to individuals, businesses, governments on a metered basis called pay-as-you-go. It has more than 70 services and they contain computing, storage, networking, database, deployment, management, analytics and tools for the Internet. For platform as a service (PaaS), Google App Engine provides a great environment in order to make and connect cloud services. It provides with computing and hosting services, networking, databases, machine learning and etc. For software as a service (SaaS), Adobe products or Visual Studio can be good instances. For example, Adobe Photoshop has scalability, which is that any user can only install, auto-update meant that it updates itself, accessibility which is using it in any kind of device.

For project management, GitHub and Trello are best practices. Firstly, GitHub is a significantly great tool for collaboration. For public projects, it requires no monthly fee. However, any other usage plans have fees from $7 to $22. Lots of developers like Zen feature. This supports about two hundred languages, working back-up, easy control and problem tracking. GitHub is recommended for app management and is highly used all over the world. Security is one of the disadvantages of GitHub, hacking is easier in storage sources. Another tool which is recommend for project management is Trello. It is free for limited usage, and has business class which has $9.99 for one year. With this tool, tasks can be divided easily, teams can achieve their time-management, they can share files, images and etc. However, it is not designed for everyone, has limited views and is not a fully-featured PM tool. But it provides great efficiency. Overall, GitHub and Trello are great tools for project management.
For designer tools, Adobe Xd is one of the important tools which can work on both iOS and Windows OS. It is free for starter plans and $9.99 per user which is cheap enough. It works with vector measurements and has high quality working conditions. It has all types of artboards, tutorials, simple and clean interfaces, repeat grid feature, most explicit feature of the software. Another tool is Adobe Photoshop which provides $20.99/year license for every individual. It works with pixel graphics. Also, in this program animations can be made.
For developer tools, best tools are Xcode and Android studio. Android studio is an open source tool. Xcode can be used freely as an Apple’s subscriber. Android studio can work on Mac OS, Windows OS and Linux. Xcode can be used on Mac OS and Linux. Xcode helps the users support source code for the programming languages Java, Python, Ruby, C++.
